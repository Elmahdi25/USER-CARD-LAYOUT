# USER-CARD-LAYOUT
This is a small HTML and CSS practice project where I built a simple profile card. The focus is on learning basic layout and styling using display block and inline-block, image handling with object-fit and object-position, spacing with margin and padding, and adding box-shadow and basic button styles.
